  <h2>What is css?</h2>>
  <ol>
    <li>CSS stands for cascading style sheet,</li>
    <li>css describes how HTML  elements are to be  displyed on screen, paper,or in other media</li>
    <li><span id="i1">Css is not neccessary</span><span class="c5">CSS saves a lot of work</span>it can control the layout of multiple web pages all at once</li>
    <li><span class="c2">External stylesheets are stored in css files</span></li>
  </ol>
  <h3>CSS  can be added to HTML documents in 3 ways:</h3>
  <div class="c3">
    <ul>
      <li>Inline- by using the style attrinbute inside HTML elements</li>
      <li>Internel- by using a style element in the head section</li>
      <li>External - by using a link element to link to an external css file.</li>
      <li>The most common way to add css, is to keep the style in external css files. However <span class="c4">In this tutorial we will use inline and internal styles.</span>because this is easier to demonstrate. and easier for you try it yourself. </li>
    </ul>
    <p>When compare to the Css class Vs ID,the difference is that css class applies a style to multiple elements.ID, on the other hand, applies a style to a one unique element. ID is also a special in that you can use the special URL to link directly to an element and its used by Javascript.</p>

    <p>In case , selectors are used to target a specific or range of elements on a web page . once an elements has been targeted, a style or set can be apllied to the elements</p>

    <p>There is a wide range of selectors available. Two of the most commonly used are class and ID .both are used to target elements to which a style should be applied. </p>
